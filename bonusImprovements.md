# Bonus - Improvements/Other Features

## Task
//FIXME remove task before submission
Create a text document and write up other features that you think this app could use.
What have we missed? Where have we gone wrong in our idea? What else would be useful?
You can come up with ideas around the UX of the app, the API that we use, other methods in voting,
logic issues, future problems or bugs, constraints, etc.

## Additional features the app could use:

### User Dashboard
Create user dashboard which could contain feature like:
    - The Nominations they have left that month (if you'd like to give them an allowance of like 3
      nominations.)
    - Any Employee of the month achievements they have received- highlighted on their dashboard.

### Year Recap of Cube of the month
- A way to reflect on final nominee with the Cube of the Month over the course of a year. I imagine
  structures like a list of the months in the year 2024. With the name and picture of the person who
  got Cube of the month that month. With a graphic disabling the upcoming month. with a button to
  make a nomination on the current month nominations are taking place.

### Additional Appreciation
- If user can only give one nomination a month, have a way for them to show appreciation to their
  colleagues which doesn't use their 1 nomination. Could be a separate bullet board style page
  with 'Appreciation notes' or since the user must login; notes which only they(and their manager
  for feedback) can see.
