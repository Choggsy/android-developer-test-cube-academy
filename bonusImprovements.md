# Bonus - Improvements/Other Features

## Task

//FIXME remove task before submission
Create a text document and write up other features that you think this app could use.
What have we missed? Where have we gone wrong in our idea? What else would be useful?
You can come up with ideas around the UX of the app, the API that we use, other methods in voting,
logic issues, future problems or bugs, constraints, etc.

## Additional features the app could use:

### User Dashboard

Create user dashboard which could contain feature like:

- The Nominations they have left that month (if you'd like to give them an allowance of like 3
  nominations.)
- Any Employee of the month achievements they have received- highlighted on their dashboard.

### Year Recap of Cube of the month

- A way to reflect on final nominee with the Cube of the Month over the course of a year. I imagine
  structures like a list of the months in the year 2024. With the name and picture of the person who
  got Cube of the month that month. With a graphic disabling the upcoming month. with a button to
  make a nomination on the current month nominations are taking place.

### App Navigation

- Additional Views would require a navigation system, a Sticky Navigation bar as part of the Top
  black header best minimal change because it is consistent on the Home Screen designs and the
  Nomination Flow. Although I wouldn't recommend it as the best HCI approach since it reads more as
  a website than an application interface choice.

### Appreciation Notes

- If user can only give one nomination a month, have a way for them to show appreciation to their
  colleagues which doesn't use their 1 nomination. Could be a separate page similar to the figma
  designs with 'Appreciation notes' or since the user must login; notes which only they(and their
  manager for feedback) can see.

### Additional Validation

- At the moment a user can make multiple Nominations for the same Nominee within a month(As Seen on
  01.00 Home Screen in the figma). This would make the nominations received potentially unfair as A
  user can vote for the same person an infinite amount of times
- Validate that a user can not make nominations for themselves.
- The Reasoning should be Mandatory and there is a maximum number of characters but there isn't a
  minimum number character, I would enforce this to prevent people just quickly making nominations
  of no substance. The reason provided would be good data to provide the Nominee as Feedback. So
  this field should be informed to require a set minimum word count
